"""Audit app/resources/top100k-domains.txt for parked/for-sale domains.

A domain-popularity dataset like Majestic Million (the source of that
list -- see its .SOURCE.md) ranks by historical/inbound-link signals, not
"does this currently serve real content" -- a chunk of any such list is
domains someone bought and never built on, sitting behind a registrar's
ad-filled "buy this domain" page. Reported concretely: an omnibox
suggestion for "x.co" led to exactly that.

This is a one-time offline maintenance script, not something Shinto runs
itself: it makes one HTTP request per domain (never repeated requests to
the same server -- the opposite of the abusive-scraping shape) and takes
a long time over 100k domains, so it's meant to be run occasionally by a
maintainer, not part of the app or its build. Writes results incrementally
(one JSON object per line) so a run can be interrupted and resumed with
--resume instead of starting over.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/find_parked_domains.py [--limit N] [--workers N]
        [--resume] [--input PATH] [--report PATH]

Then, once a report exists, prune the list with:
    python3 scripts/prune_parked_domains.py
