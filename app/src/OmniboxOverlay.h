// The native omnibox: a widget drawn on top of a BrowserWindow's
// QWebEngineView. One appearance: a caret at the top-left, no visible
// field at rest -- used both for a fresh window's empty gate and for
// Ctrl+L on an already-loaded page (which shows this same blank gate over
// the still-loaded page, rather than a prefilled address bar). A dropdown
// appears below the input as you type, filling whatever vertical room the
// window has (maxSuggestionRows()), blending two sources into one ranked
// list rather than showing one before the other (updateSuggestions()): the
// user's own visited history (HistoryStore::completeVisited()) and offline
// domain-prefix suggestions (PopularDomains) -- a page you've actually used
// usually wins, but a strong domain match can still outrank a history entry
// you've only visited once or twice. Nothing typed ever leaves the machine
// to power either. Rows fade toward the background
// color going down the list (renderSuggestions()) so a long list reads as
// "the top few matter most", not a wall of equally-loud text. Every row
// has a per-row "x" button to dismiss it -- permanently, from HistoryStore
// or PopularDomains' respective backing store, whichever it came from.
//
// This is never a navigable URL -- Escape simply hides it, since the
// underlying page (if any) was never touched.
